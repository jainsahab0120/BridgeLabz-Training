This is a sample large file used for performance testing.
The purpose of this file is to simulate reading a very large dataset.
Each line contains multiple words separated by spaces.
This helps in counting words efficiently using different stream readers.

In real world applications, files can be very large.
Examples include log files, server backups, data exports, and reports.
Efficient file reading is important for performance critical systems.

Java provides FileReader for character-based reading.
Java also provides InputStreamReader to convert byte streams to character streams.
BufferedReader is used to improve reading performance.

This file is intentionally repetitive.
Repetition helps in increasing file size without changing logic.
Testing large files helps understand IO bottlenecks.

Reading large files line by line is safer than reading the entire file at once.
Memory consumption stays under control.
This approach is commonly used in enterprise applications.
